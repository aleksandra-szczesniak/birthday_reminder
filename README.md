# birthday_reminder
This app reminds you about your friends' birthdays in next week.

Just throw in the dictionary with your friends' birthdays and never forget to wish them a happy birthday.

The dictionary structure should look like this:
dict = [
{"name": name, "birthday": date(1970, 1, 1)},
]

The program is designed to remind you to send wishes at your workplace, so people celebrating their birthdays on the weekend will be displayed on Monday.
